    "- In order to work with a jupyter notebook that allows for `markdown` and `code chunks`, it is most importanat to note the difference between `command` mode and `edit` mode. \n",
    "    + `Command` mode is activated when a `blue border` is around the highlighted chunk and often can be obtained by pressing `ESC`\n",
    "    + This implies that you can add a new chunk using `A` or `B`, change the current chunk into a markdown chunk using `M`, or a code chunk using `Y`, activate help to find all shortcuts using `H` \n",
    "    + During the `Command` mode anything you type is considered a command for the notebook and will not be typed into the chunk. \n",
    "    + `Edit` mode is activated when a `green border` is highlighting the chunk you are at and can be attained by pressing `Enter`.\n",
    "    + This implies you are editing the current chunk by writing code or text depending on the type of chunk it is.\n",
    "    + A code chunk can be determined by a `In []` to the left of the chunk and a markdown chunk does not have a `In []`. Moreover, a markdown chunk can be run using `CMD + ENTER` in which case it looks like a PDF."
