    "1. Python is one of the most promising programming language released in 1991 by `Guido Van Rossum`.\n",
    "1. It is useful for creation of web applications, for software development, and now a lot in data science and it is constantly evolving.\n",
    "1. It has an easy `syntax` similar to English, simple to read and write.\n",
    "1. The most recent major version of Python is `Python 3.10` although Python 2 is still used majorly inside mac systems for development.\n",
    "1. We can use Python via `command line`, IDE's like `PyCharm`, or applications such as `Jupyter Notebook`. \n",
    "1. Python works on all the different platforms like `Windows, Mac, Linux`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### As a language:\n",
    "1. It is a high-level object oriented programming language with built-in data structures, methods, operators and functions.\n",
    "1. It also allows these to be used to build more different data structures and methods that work with them.\n"
